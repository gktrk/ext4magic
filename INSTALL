Install ext4magic
===================


Quick Install HOWTO 
==================== 

You have to compile the ext4magic source code. It install a binary program /usr/local/sbin/ext4magic and a manpage
This works only on Linux (also Big-Endian-CPUs)
Other UNIX operating systems will not compile.
You need the packages :
 
 gcc
 make

Furthermore, there are dependencies to following libraries:
 
 libmagic
 libext2fs
 libz
 libbz2

These libraries are present on any Linux, but you need some actual versions.
Check the version with the following commands:

   # file -v
   # /sbin/fsck.ext3 -V

the version of "file" must be > 5.03
and the EXT2FS Library version >= 1.41.9       (libext2fs-1.42 see Known Bugs) 



Under these conditions, installation is fairly simple.
Install the following devel packages:
There are possibley different names according your Linux distribution

openSuse                        debian                 Fedora
----------------------------------------------------------------------
libext2fs-devel                 e2fslibs-dev        e2fsprogs-devel 
libuuid-devel                   uuid-dev            libuuid-devel 
libblkid-devel                  libblkid-dev        libblkid-devel 
file-devel			libmagic-dev	    file-devel
zlib-devel			zlib1g-dev		    ?
libbz2-devel			libbz2-dev		    ?

unzip the archive and cd into the directory

   # tar -xzf ext4magic-?.?.?.tar.gz
   # cd ext4magic-?.?.?

The following commands to compile ext4magic

   # ./configure
   # make

and install as root

   # make install


this is everything, and it installs the following files

/usr/local/sbin/ext4magic
/usr/local/share/man/man8/ext4magic.8



Optional extensions
====================
with configure the following extensions can be activated

--enable-expert-mode      # use of file system superblock copies 
                            and recover from partially destroyed file systems

--enable-file-attr        # restore also file attributes

Detailed Install Howto for special cases
========================================

Following detailed instructions for installing considered special cases,
depends on the library versions also on older operating systems or
if the devel package can not be found or if certain libraries to be statically linked.



The file-command and the library libmagic
========================================
In versions ext4magic > 0.1.4  you need the package of the  Linux command "file".
Needed a version > 5.03 (see also BUG:#017561) for stabil magic-functions in ext4magic.
Which version is installed displays the following command

# file -v

If found 5.04 on your Linux, install also the devel package, or you must create a symlink of the library. (see follow)


No version 5.04 for your Linux available? You can also install version file-5.04  from source.
download ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/

You can uninstall the older version of "file" (not recommended) if it has no dependencies to other packages. (eg. perl,apache,...)
If the old version deleted, the new must necessarily configured to /usr and not to /usr/local.

Or you can install a second version to /usr/local (recommended)
In this case, do not install the devel package of an old version.

The following illustrates the installation of a second version

 # tar -xzf file-5.04.tar.gz
 # cd file-5.04
 # ./configure
 # make
 # su -
 # cd ????/file-5.04
 # make install
 # ldconfig


The following command should now show both, the version in "/usr/lib/" and in "/usr/local/lib/"
(If use a 64-bit system, the library path can also be /usr/lib64 and /usr/local/lib64)
 # ldconfig -p | grep libmagic
        libmagic.so.1 (libc6) => /usr/local/lib/libmagic.so.1
        libmagic.so.1 (libc6) => /usr/lib/libmagic.so.1
        libmagic.so (libc6) => /usr/local/lib/libmagic.so

In this case, the symlink "/usr/lib/libmagic.so" should not exist. (see follow)
If the new version libmagic is now not available in /usr/local/... , or the following command failed

 #/usr/local/bin/file -v

then try the following command as root
 # ldconfig /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib64
and check again.


Which of the two libmagic versions the finished ext4magic use, you can check with:
# ldd /usr/local/sbin/ext4magic | grep libmagic
        libmagic.so.1 => /usr/local/lib/libmagic.so.1 (0xb7741000)





If you get the following error during configure ext4magic:

"library libmagic.so >= 5.04 not found, install package "file-5.04" and "file-devel" (workaround see INSTALL)"

and >= "file-5.04" is installed, then no file "libmagic.so" is found, probably the devel package is not installed. 
Not for all distributions it is available. You can work around that by generate a symlink "libmagic.so" to the 
existing version of this library. (on a 64-bit system, the library path can also be /usr/lib64 )

see the following log:
# cd /usr/lib
# ln -s libmagic.so.1 libmagic.so
# ls -l /usr/lib/libmagic*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     13 Sep 23 01:40 /usr/lib/libmagic.so -> libmagic.so.1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     17 Aug 28 16:09 /usr/lib/libmagic.so.1 -> libmagic.so.1.0.0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 116720 Oct 24  2009 /usr/lib/libmagic.so.1.0.0

For more than one version of libmagic:
The version for compiling with ext4magic should have the symlink "libmagic.so"
another version of libmagic should not have this symlink. 







Devel packages and librarys of libext2fs
========================================
First check your current version of libext2fs with the following command
 # /sbin/fsck.ext3 -V



if Version >= 1.41.9  
===================
Install the following devel packages:
There are possibley different names according your Linux distribution

openSuse                        debian                 Fedora
----------------------------------------------------------------------
libext2fs-devel                 e2fslibs-dev        e2fsprogs-devel 
libuuid-devel                   uuid-dev            libuuid-devel 
libblkid-devel                  libblkid-dev        libblkid-devel 


then compile ext4magic
 # tar -xzf ext4magic-0.3.0.tar.gz
 # cd ext4magic-0.3.0
 # ./configure
 # make
 # su 
 # make install



if Version < 1.41.9
===================
download a actual version of e2fsprogs from http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/
 # tar -xzf e2fsprogs-1.41.9.tar.gz
 # cd e2fsprogs-1.41.9
 # ./configure
 # make
Important: Please do not install this version. 
This could create problems with programs of your current distribution ..


save the actual directory path of lib/ in a variable for future use in configure commandline.
# EXT2LIB="$(pwd)/lib"

After this, change into the code directory of ext4magic
 # tar -xzf ext4magic-0.3.0.tar.gz
 # cd ext4magic-0.3.0
 # ./configure CFLAGS="-I$EXT2LIB" LDFLAGS="-L$EXT2LIB" LIBS="-luuid -lcom_err -lpthread"
 # make
 # su
 # make install


ext4magic is so static linked to the newer library. You can see different version of libext2fs by:
 # ext4magic -V x
 # /sbin/fsck.ext3 -V
